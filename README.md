# ResiliOnt: The Resilience Core Ontology 

## Overview

Amid rising global challenges, resilience is attracting increased interest across various disciplines. However, significant ambiguities, vagueness, and variations in its definitions present notable obstacles to interdisciplinary communication and practical application. These semantic issues negatively impact not only the applications that rely on these definitions but also undermine the integrity of the conceptual models built from them, rendering them unable to ensure interoperability and clarity for their intended users. Recognizing the need for a robust and clear definition of resilience, this work addresses the complexity inherent in the concept by performing an ontological analysis using the Unified Foundational Ontology (UFO) and creating a sound core ontology model with OntoUML, UFO’s related conceptual modeling language.

## Objective

This repository hosts ResiliOnt, a core ontology that aims to provide a clear and robust definition of resilience by leveraging the Unified Foundational Ontology (UFO) and OntoUML. By addressing the ambiguities and inconsistencies in existing definitions of resilience, ResiliOnt seeks to ensure interoperability and clarity across various domains and facilitate interdisciplinary research.

## Methodology

### Ontological Foundations

Our analysis is grounded in the Unified Foundational Ontology (UFO). UFO is a well-established foundational ontology that has been successfully employed in numerous ontological analyses in fields as complex as economics, software engineering, treatments, and decision-making processes. Among all the applications of UFO, its role in the design of OntoUML is the most significant. OntoUML is a conceptual modeling language with explicitly defined formal and real-world semantics that reflects the ontological micro-theories of UFO. It serves as an engineering tool for enabling the use of formal ontological theories in the construction of conceptual models and domain ontologies.

### Analysis and Conceptualization

In our analysis, we explore fundamental aspects of resilience by questioning:
- Whether resilience is an inherent quality of an object or an outcome observed only after an object has endured a disturbance.
- What is necessary for objects to possess resilience.
- When resilience is actually achieved within an object.
- When it can be observed.

By systematically exploring these aspects, we aim to provide an ontologically well-founded definition of resilience.

## Ontology

ResiliOnt aims to bridge the gaps in the current understanding of resilience by providing a clear, robust, and ontologically well-founded definition of the concept. By leveraging the Unified Foundational Ontology and OntoUML, this core ontology seeks to enhance interdisciplinary communication, improve the integrity of conceptual models, and facilitate the practical application of resilience across various domains.

## Related Ontologies

ResiliOnt leverages concepts from the [Common Ontology of Value and Risk (COVER)](https://github.com/unibz-core/value-and-risk-ontology) and the Capabilities Ontology. These ontologies provide the baseline for understanding concepts used in ResiliOnt, such as the relationships between capabilities and concepts such as vulnerabilities and threats.
