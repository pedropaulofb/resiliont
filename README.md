# ResiliOnt: The Resilience Core Ontology 

This repository hosts ResiliOnt, a core ontology that aims to provide a clear and robust definition of resilience by leveraging the Unified Foundational Ontology (UFO) and OntoUML. By addressing the ambiguities and inconsistencies in existing definitions of resilience, ResiliOnt seeks to ensure interoperability and clarity across various domains and facilitate interdisciplinary research.

## Related Ontologies

ResiliOnt leverages concepts from the [Common Ontology of Value and Risk (COVER)](https://github.com/unibz-core/value-and-risk-ontology) and the Capabilities Ontology. These ontologies provide the baseline for understanding concepts used in ResiliOnt, such as the relationships between capabilities and concepts like vulnerabilities and threats.

- [**COVER**](https://www.academia.edu/download/82803282/the_common_ontology_of_value_and_risk_2018.pdf): Introduces key concepts such as Objects at Risk, Threat Events, and Vulnerabilities, which are integral to modeling resilience. For more details, please refer to:

- [**Capabilities Ontology**](https://nemo.inf.ufes.br/wp-content/papercite-data/pdf/a_system_core_ontology_for_capability_emergence_modeling_2023.pdf): Explores the nature of capabilities and their enabling and disabling relationships, contributing to a deeper understanding of how resilience can be achieved and observed.
